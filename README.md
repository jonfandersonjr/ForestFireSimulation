# ForestFireSimulation
A simulation with emergent behavior representing how forest fires spread.

Green patches represent grass/trees that are unaffected by fire. Gray patches represent ash and are a result of burnt patches - ashes eventually turn back into living (green) patches after some time has passed. Red areas represent fire and spreads to green but not gray and dies out either by good fortune or lack of area to grow.
